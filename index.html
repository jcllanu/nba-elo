                Traditional metrics have convinced us that greatness can be
                reduced to points, efficiency, or rings. But basketball is
                ultimately about <strong>winning</strong>.
                <strong>Winning</strong> means impacting the outcome of every
                game, not just stacking stats. <strong>Winning</strong> requires
                influencing your teammates and outmaneuvering your opponents,
                game after game regardless of which team is the favorite on
                paper. <strong>Winning</strong> is what separates legends from
                the rest — and that’s exactly what this new metric measures.
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Inspired by the ELO system from chess — one of the most
                respected and widely used rating systems in the world — we
                introduce the
                <strong>ELO Rating system for NBA players</strong>. This metric
                applies principles proven reliable for decades in a very
                different competitive context. It measures a player’s impact
                with precision and consistency, and one of its most powerful
                advantages is that it allows us to
                <strong>compare players from completely different eras</strong>,
                even if they never faced each other.
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Most traditional metrics fail here because they ignore the
                quality of the opposition, treating every point or win as equal.
                Wilt Chamberlain is often accused of playing against “plumbers”,
                while people mock LeBron James for playing in a soft era of
                “TikTokers”. This metric, however, accounts not only for the
                level of the opponent but also the strength of the player’s own
                team, providing a fair way to evaluate dominance across
                generations and finally answer the hardest of questions:
                <strong
                  >who truly rises above the rest, no matter the era?</strong
                >
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Another key feature is that it
                <strong>
                  rewards overperformance against strong opponents</strong
                >
                and
                <strong> penalizes underperformance against weak ones</strong>.
                Unlike traditional box-score metrics, it recognizes that a
                30-point blowout win against a weak team isn’t the same as
                leading your squad to victory against the league’s best. By
                capturing both successes and failures
                <strong>relative to the quality of competition</strong>, the
                metric emphasizes accountability, consistency, and real impact.
                Those who reliably overperform under pressure rise to the top,
                while players who occasionally shine but underperform in
                critical moments are exposed — mirroring how chess ratings
                balance wins and losses to measure true skill.
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                By adapting ELO to basketball, we can finally quantify greatness
                in a way that
                <strong
                  >respects context, competition, and true influence</strong
                >
                on the court. It’s not just about points or rings — it’s about
                <strong>winning</strong> consistently against the best and
                avoiding costly losses against the worst. This metric provides a
                fresh lens for the GOAT debate, one grounded in logic, data, and
                competitive reality.

                Before diving into basketball, it’s worth recalling how the ELO
                system works in chess. The ELO system in chess is a simple yet
                powerful way to quantify a player’s skill relative to their
                opponents. Each player starts with a base rating, and after
                every game, their score is adjusted based on the result and the
                rating of the opponent. Beating a higher-rated opponent
                increases your rating more than beating a lower-rated one, while
                losing to a weaker player results in a larger decrease. Over
                time, this dynamic system produces a numerical rating that
                reflects not only wins and losses but also the
                <strong>context and difficulty of each match</strong>. This
                enables players from different eras or tournaments to be
                <strong>compared on a common scale</strong>. After every game,
                the rating is adjusted using the following formula:
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                $$ R' = R + K \cdot (S-E) $$
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Where \(R\) is the current rating, \(R'\) the updated rating,
                \(K\) the sensitivity factor, \(S\) the actual result (1 for
                win, 0.5 for draw, 0 for loss), and \(E\) the expected result
                calculated using the opponent’s rating:
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                $$ E = \frac{1}{1+10^{(R_{opponent}-R)/400}}$$
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                This system has proven extremely effective in chess at measuring
                skill dynamically, taking into account both victories and
                defeats relative to the strength of the opposition.

                With this foundation in mind, the first challenge in adapting
                this system to basketball is that it is a
                <strong>team sport</strong>, and we aim to measure the
                performance of an <strong>individual player</strong> rather than
                the team as a whole. In chess, each game has a single winner and
                loser, but in basketball, multiple players contribute
                simultaneously and diversely to a single outcome. Additionally,
                there is already extensive research and multiple examples that
                use ELO to rank teams in different competitions: NBA, football,
                soccer... However, our goal is to rank players, not teams.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                To address this, we start by defining a
                <strong
                  >team’s rating based on the ratings of its individual
                  players</strong
                >. A natural approach is to consider the team rating as the
                weighted average of the ratings of all players on the court,
                where weights reflect minutes played. This makes intuitive and
                mathematical sense: not all players contribute equally to the
                outcome of a game. A starter playing 36 minutes has far more
                influence than a bench player with 5 minutes on the court.
                Weighting by minutes ensures that the team rating truly reflects
                each player’s contribution, rather than treating all
                participants as equal, which would distort the expected outcome
                and undermine the reliability of the ELO updates for individual
                players. Formally,

                One important aspect of this metric is that it incorporates the
                <strong> actual minutes each player spends on the court</strong

                that in-game events, such as injuries or unexpected
                substitutions, naturally affect the player’s contribution and
                rating adjustments. In other words, the metric captures a
                player’s <strong>true impact on the outcome </strong> rather
                than an estimate based on pre-game expectations. This makes the
                rating more accurate and reflective of real performance, but it
                also means that it cannot fully predict performance ahead of

                Once we have defined the ratings of the two teams, we can
                calculate the <strong>expected outcome</strong> \(E\) for a
                matchup using the classic ELO formula, applied to team ratings:
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                $$ E_{team A} = \frac{1}{1+10^{(R_{team B}-R_{team A})/400}}$$
                $$ E_{team B} = 1 - E_{team A}$$

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Where \(R_{team A}\) and \(R_{team B}\) are the ratings of Team
                A and Team B, respectively.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Let’s give some intuition on the formula. The expected score
                \(E\) essentially represents the probability that a team will
                win based on its rating relative to the opponent. If two teams
                have identical ratings, \(E=50\%\), meaning each team has an
                equal chance of winning. As the rating difference grows, \(E\)
                shifts closer to \(100\%\) for the stronger team and closer to
                \(0\%\) for the weaker team, reflecting an increasingly lopsided
                expected outcome.
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                In other words, \(E\) captures
                <strong>how surprising a result would be</strong>: a win against
                a much stronger team should count more, while a loss to a much
                weaker team should be judged more harshly. This is exactly why
                ELO naturally rewards overperformance and penalizes
                underperformance, making it a dynamic and context-sensitive
                measure of success.

                  >For every 400-point difference in rating, the higher-rated

                skill.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Continuing with the previous example of the Finals game between
                the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics, in which we had
                calculated Boston’s rating as <strong>\(1,267.75\)</strong> and
                Los Angeles’ rating as <strong>\(1,296.14\)</strong>, the
                formula above tells us that the probability of Boston winning
                was <strong>\(45.9\%\)</strong>, which gives
                <strong>\(54.1\%\)</strong> chances of Los Angeles winning. As
                expected, a higher rating corresponds to a greater win
                expectancy.

                might be. For example,
                <strong>Michael Jordan’s 63-point game</strong> against the
                Boston Celtics in the 1986 playoffs or
                <strong>LeBron James’ 51-point game </strong>against the Golden
                State Warriors in the 2018 Finals both resulted in ELO
                decreases. And that’s exactly how it should be:
                <strong>in basketball, winning is all that matters</strong>.
                Consequently, your rating improves if, and only if, your team
                wins.

                weaker opponent, the term is negative, causing a decrease. This
                is the core component that reflects whether a player’s team—and

                change according to minutes played—normalized to a 36-minute
                standard—the formula ensures that players who spend more time on
                the court have a proportionally greater impact on their rating.
                A starter playing the bulk of the game will see larger rating

                both experienced the same team result. Consequently, a loss
                penalizes starters more than bench players, and a win rewards
                starters more heavily as well, reflecting their greater

                To conclude the example that has accompanied us throughout the
                explanation, let’s calculate the updated ELO rankings for the
                players who participated in Game 6 of the 1985 NBA Finals, which
                ended with the Los Angeles Lakers winning \(100\)–\(111\). Let’s
                start by updating the ELO rankings of the Boston players. Since
                the Boston Celtics lost the game, their \(S\) value is 0. The
                percentage \(E\) had already been calculated and was \(45.9\%\).
                Since this was a playoff game, the \(K\) parameter is \(32\).
                Finally, the minutes played determine the adjustment for each
                player. For reference, for a player who played \(36\) minutes,
                the ELO point decrease is \(14.70\). In the following table, we
                show, for each Boston Celtics player, their minutes played, the
                ELO rating before the game, the ELO change, and finally the new
                ELO rating.

                Now we repeat the calculations for the Los Angeles Lakers
                players. First, since Los Angeles won the game, the value of
                \(S\) is \(1\). On the other hand, the expected win percentage
                \(E\) had already been calculated and is \(54.1\%\), while the
                parameter \(K\) remains \(32\) because this was a playoff game.
                Finally, the minutes played depend on each individual player. As
                a reference point, for a Lakers player who played \(36\)
                minutes, their ELO increase would be \(14.70\) points. It’s
                important to note that this system guarantees a zero-sum
                structure: the total ELO lost by the players on one team is
                gained by the players on the other. The following table shows
                the ELO rating before and after the game, along with the ELO
                gain and the minutes played by each Lakers player.

                  <strong>Table 5.- </strong> ELO rating updates for Los Angeles
                  Lakers players after Game 6 of the 1985 NBA Finals (June 9,
                  1985).

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                As shown in the tables above, the change in ELO depends on court
                time. For example, James Worthy, who played \(45\) minutes, sees
                an ELO increase of \(18.37\) points, while Bob McAdoo, who
                played only \(10\) minutes, gains just \(4.08\) ELO points. This
                is consistent with the goal of rewarding real impact on the
                outcome of the game. Similarly, Dennis Johnson, who played
                \(43\) minutes, experiences a larger ELO decrease (\(-17.55\)
                ELO points) than Greg Kite, who played only \(11\) minutes and
                lost \(4.49\) ELO points.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Looking at this from another perspective, if this had been a
                regular season game instead of a playoff matchup, the ELO
                changes would not have been as significant. In fact, if the game
                had taken place during the regular season, then for every 36
                minutes played, the Los Angeles players would have gained
                \(7.35\) ELO points—exactly half of what they earned in the
                playoff game.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Lastly, one might wonder how the ratings would have changed if
                Boston had won the game instead. Would the Lakers players have
                simply lost \(14.70\) points per 36 minutes played, just as the
                opposite occurred? The answer is <strong>no</strong>. Since in
                this case the probability of a Lakers win was slightly higher
                than that of Boston, the rating system would have rewarded this
                upset slightly more strongly (or penalized the Lakers slightly
                more heavily). For every 36 minutes played, Boston players would
                have increased their ELO by \(17.30\) points. As we’ve
                emphasized throughout the explanation,
                <strong
                  >overperforming or underperforming relative to expectations
                  has a greater impact on ELO ratings</strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Now that we’ve explained how this metric is built, justified its
                validity, and highlighted its strengths for evaluating players
                fairly and with proper context, obtaining the historical
                evolution of each player’s ELO series becomes straightforward.
                It’s only worth noting that the chosen base rating is 1000,
                again inspired by chess. In other words, when a player enters
                the league, their initial rating is 1000, and as they win or
                lose games, this rating increases or decreases according to the
                dynamic system described above. All of this allows us to bring a
                <strong

                  about who is the true NBA GOAT. From now on, greatness isn’t

                The ELO rankings are full of jaw-dropping results—some of these
                positions no one could have seen coming. Legends end up
                shockingly high or surprisingly low, completely rewriting what
                we thought we knew about their careers. To unpack it all, the
                discussion is split into three parts: first, the biggest
                surprises, where the data defies expectations; second, a
                position-by-position breakdown to see how stars performed across
                roles; and finally, what it all adds to the ever-heated GOAT
                debate.

                  The biggest surprise may be seeing Chris Paul ranked third in
                  peak ELO and sixth in average ELO, and Vlade Divac sixth in
                  peak and fourteenth in average</strong

                <strong
                  >Paul’s teams, across nearly twenty seasons, consistently
                  improved wherever he went</strong
                >: he turned the Hornets into regular playoff contenders, the
                Clippers rose from irrelevance to a Western Conference
                powerhouse, the Rockets peaked with him alongside Harden, the
                young Thunder overperformed, laying the foundations for their
                bright future, and the Suns jumped from lottery to the Finals.
                He is the definition of a floor general—dictating tempo,
                organizing offense, and making teammates better—while
                maintaining elite play over nearly two decades.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Vlade Divac’s influence was more subtle but equally meaningful.
                Over his career, he maintained a regular season win percentage
                above \(60\%\). He improved floor spacing, facilitated offense,
                and created opportunities for teammates such as Chris Webber,
                helping his teams overperform relative to expectations. Divac’s
                contributions often went unnoticed in traditional statistics,
                but an ELO-based system captures his
                <strong
                  >consistent, context-adjusted impact on team success</strong
                >.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                From an ELO perspective, the comparison is striking: in regular
                season losses, Chris Paul’s and Vlade Divac's teams were on
                average only \(18.40\) and \(21.31\) ELO points better than
                their opponents. As a reference, that's far lower than the
                average ELO advantage of \(133.15\), \(109.92\), and \(135.62\)
                points for Bill Russell, Larry Bird, or Magic Johnson. In
                regular season wins, Chris Paul’s teams were just \(94.00\)
                points better while this figure rises to \(103.67\) for Divac's
                teams. In comparison, that's less than Wilt Chamberlain
                (\(129.26\)) or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (\(141.62\)). These numbers
                illustrate how both players consistently exceeded expectations
                with their teams. Together, these metrics highlight why both
                Paul and Divac rank so highly.
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                It may be surprising not to see Kobe Bryant ranked near the top
                in these ELO metrics, especially since he is widely regarded as
                a top-10 player of all time and has a résumé that includes
                <strong> five NBA championships</strong>
                and multiple MVP-level seasons. Many fans even include him in
                the GOAT conversation due to his cultural impact and his
                legendary winning mentality.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                However, throughout most of his career, Kobe played on extremely
                strong teams and was surrounded by other stars. His early titles
                came while playing alongside Shaquille O’Neal, one of the most
                dominant forces in NBA history, and later he benefited from
                talented supporting casts built around him in Los Angeles. Since
                ELO heavily values a player’s individual contribution on team
                performance, being part of stacked rosters can limit how high a
                player rises in these rankings. In fact, between 1998 and 2011
                his team's were favored by \(119.88\) ELO points on average on
                regular season games and \(62.72\) in playoff games, so his
                expectations to win were high.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                This context is reflected in Kobe’s ELO trajectory. His peak ELO
                sits outside the very top tier, and his average ELO rank drops
                even further. In the final phase of his career, prolonged
                injuries and less competitive Lakers teams pulled his numbers
                down significantly. Unexpected playoff losses also hurt his
                rating. For example, the 2004 NBA Finals defeat against the
                Detroit Pistons heavily penalized his ELO because the Lakers
                entered the series as clear favorites. Additionally, major
                disappointments in later seasons—such as the 2012–13 campaign,
                when he played alongside stars like Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol,
                and Steve Nash—further affected his numbers, as injuries and
                underperforming teams limited his impact.

                Other notable absences include Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell,
                and Oscar Robertson, who rank only 28th, 38th, and fall outside
                the top 50 in peak ELO, and are also outside the top 50 in
                average ELO. This is largely because the competition faced by
                their teams was relatively weak, with average opponent ELOs of
                just \(1,055.47\), \(1,040.98\), and \(1,053.06\), compared to
                their own teams’ ELOs of \(1,144.67\), \(1,185.56\), and
                \(1,111.35\), respectively. As a reference, the ELO of opposing
                teams faced by Kevin Durant, David Robinson, and Scottie Pippen
                is generally around \(1,070\)-\(1,080\). While this may not seem
                like a huge gap, over the course of a long NBA career, it can
                definitely make a significant difference.

                Finally, while there are many other surprising omissions and
                unexpected rankings in the ELO lists, one that stands out in
                particular is Allen Iverson. Despite his undeniable legacy and
                profound cultural impact, Iverson’s lack of significant team
                success—largely due to the absence of a strong supporting
                cast—has prevented him from climbing higher in both peak and
                average ELO ratings. His case highlights how ELO not only

                statistical standing.

                Next, we break down the rankings by position, examining how
                players in each role—point guards, shooting guards, small
                forwards, power forwards, and centers—stack up in both peak and
                average ELO.
              </p>

              <h3 class="page-title-alt">Point guards</h3>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                As previously discussed,
                <strong>Chris Paul</strong> stands out with a peak ranking of
                3rd and an average of 6th, but looking at other all-time greats,
                <strong> Stephen Curry</strong> (9th highest rating, 16th
                average) and <strong>Magic Johnson</strong> (16th highest
                rating, 15th average) offer an interesting contrast in styles:
                Curry reshaped the game with his stellar shooting and
                off-the-ball movement, while Magic combined size, passing, and
                versatility to control games in a different way. Both rank high
                in the tables, though some might have expected Magic to be
                ranked a little bit higher. Certainly, the star-studded Showtime
                Lakers made winning more of an obligation than a possibility,
                which has somewhat limited his ranking. Indeed, his team's
                average ELO advantage was \(150.46\), while Curry's teams had an
                ELO advantage of just \(88.61\) points. Although this last
                figure may be surprising, since Stephen Curry has played on what
                is considered one of the best teams in NBA history, if not the
                very best, it should be noted that in the early years of his
                career and from 2020 onward, his teams were not nearly as
                dominant.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                <strong>Steve Nash</strong>, ranked 8th in highest rating and
                9th in mean rating, consistently contributed at an elite level,
                slightly ahead of <strong>Jason Kidd</strong>
                (22nd peak, 18th average), whose sustained impact over many
                seasons also left a mark on the league.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Two stars from the same era follow closely.
                <strong>John Stockton</strong> ranks 18th in peak and 37th in
                average, his longevity anchoring his position, while
                <strong>Isiah Thomas</strong> sits 27th in highest rating and
                22nd in mean, reflecting a shorter but highly impactful prime.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                <strong>Russell Westbrook</strong> (19th in peak, 20th in

                in average) occupy a similar tier but represent a more recent
                generation, combining explosive production with varying levels
                of team success.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Finally, the emerging class is beginning to break through. A
                surprising <strong>Jrue Holiday</strong> reaches 23rd in maximum
                rating and 33rd in average. Meanwhile
                <strong>Luka Dončić</strong> appears 32nd in peak but falls
                outside the top 50 in average, and the current NBA MVP and NBA
                Champion <strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</strong> just makes the
                top 50 in peak while missing the average list—signaling
                significant promise, but an early career characterized by a
                rebuiliding process.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Several historically significant point guards also appear just
                outside the very top tiers. <strong>Jerry West</strong> ranks
                25th in peak and 30th in average,
                <strong>Chauncey Billups</strong> is 31st in highest rating and
                outside the top 50 in average, and
                <strong>Tony Parker</strong> sits 35th in peak and also outside
                the average top 50.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Even more striking are the absences of
                <strong>Oscar Robertson</strong>, <strong>Gary Payton</strong>,
                and <strong>Allen Iverson</strong>, who finish outside the top
                50 in both categories. Their omissions underscore how era, team
                support, and style of play can shape ELO impact in ways that
                don’t always align with legacy or reputation.

                <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> stands where everyone
                expected—first among the shooting guards, though 2nd in peak and
                4th in average overall. This may not please many Jordan fans,
                but we'll get to it later on. Beyond him, however, the list
                takes an unexpected turn: <strong>Kobe Bryant</strong> appears
                only 46th in peak and outside the top 50 in average, and
                <strong>Dwyane Wade</strong> doesn’t make either list.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> manages to get 40th in maximum
                rating but also falls short in average. Several other all-time
                greats are surprisingly missing, including
                <strong>Reggie Miller</strong>, <strong>Clyde Drexler</strong>,
                <strong>Tracy McGrady</strong>, and

                <strong>Klay Thompson</strong> (43rd in average) and
                <strong>Manu Ginóbili</strong> (39th in average) barely make the
                cut in one metric and are absent in the other. This suggests
                that the ELO metric may not fully capture certain aspects of

                <strong>The ELO rankings for forwards</strong> reveal both
                expected dominance and some unexpected names. At the very top,
                <strong>LeBron James</strong> stands alone, ranking 1st in both
                peak and average ELO, a testament to his unmatched longevity,
                versatility, and sustained team impact across two decades. No
                other forward comes remotely close to the impact that James has
                had on their team's success.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Just below him, <strong>Scottie Pippen</strong> (11th peak, 10th
                mean) and <strong>Larry Bird</strong> (15th maximum rating, 7th
                average) highlight two very different kinds of
                greatness—Pippen’s all-around defensive brilliance and
                adaptability as a secondary star, and Bird’s offensive mastery
                and leadership during one of the NBA’s most competitive eras.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Perhaps the most surprising entry among forwards is
                <strong>Andre Iguodala</strong>, who ranks 17th in peak and 29th
                in average, placing slightly ahead of
                <strong>Kevin Durant</strong> in peak (24th in both peak and
                mean). Iguodala’s numbers reflect the ELO model’s sensitivity to
                team overperformance and context—his pivotal role in multiple
                championship runs with the Warriors contrasts with Durant’s
                often dominant but higher-expected-value teams. So yes, perhaps
                if the fate of the universe is on the line..., ELO might just
                say: I want Iguodala!

                in average) and <strong>Julius Erving</strong> (49th in peak,
                44th in average) maintain strong showings despite competing
                across very different eras and systems, illustrating the depth
                and evolution of the forward position over time.

                <strong>Elgin Baylor</strong>, three forwards whose careers took
                very different paths. Leonard, ranked 50th in average, remains
                one of the trickiest players to place—his career has combined
                remarkable peaks and championship success with extended absences
                due to injury. Anthony’s prolific scoring and longevity kept his
                teams consistently competitive, though rarely among the league’s
                very best, while Baylor’s brilliance came in an earlier, smaller

                8th, showing not only his incredible peak performance but also
                his sustained excellence over a long career. His unique
                combination of shooting, scoring versatility, and floor spacing
                redefined the power forward role.

                seasons but slightly lower sustained dominance relative to Dirk.
                <strong>Kevin Garnett</strong>, a defensive and all-around

                The ELO rankings of historical big men reveal some fascinating
                patterns that contrast conventional perceptions of dominance.
                <strong>Shaquille O’Neal</strong> ranks 4th in highest ELO
                rating and 3rd in average, showing that he not only reached
                extraordinary heights but maintained elite performance
                consistently. <strong>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</strong>, by contrast,
                has a slightly lower peak (10th) but ranks 5th in average ELO,
                reflecting his longevity and consistent excellence over decades.
                <strong>Tim Duncan</strong>, possibly the most underrated big
                man in the history of the game, shows an interesting contrast:
                5th in peak but 2nd in average, illustrating his sustained
                impact rather than single-season dominance.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Other Hall-of-Famers present intriguing surprises.
                <strong>David Robinson</strong> is 12th in highest ELO rating
                and 11th in average, a solid but not top-tier placement, while
                <strong>Hakeem Olajuwon</strong> is 14th in peak and 17th in
                average, highlighting his great peak performance but somewhat
                lower sustained dominance compared to Shaq or Duncan.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Some notable results involve older legends.
                <strong>Wilt Chamberlain</strong> ranks 28th in peak and falls
                outside the top 50 in average, while
                <strong>Bill Russell</strong> sits 38th in average and is not in
                the top 50 for highest ELO rating. These placements indicate
                that, despite their historical dominance, factors such as team
                performance and era of competition may have limited their ELO
                impact. <strong>Patrick Ewing</strong> similarly ranks 36th in
                peak and outside the top 50 in average, largely because he
                played in an era of the NBA with exceptionally strong
                competition.

                Finally, <strong>Nikola Jokic</strong>, the modern era big man,
                ranks 26th in peak and 36th in average, reflecting a high but
                not historically exceptional peak and solid contributions over

                All things considered, when the question of the NBA’s GOAT comes
                up, the pool of realistic candidates narrows quickly once we
                apply a consistent, impact-based standard like ELO. The
                candidacies of legends such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt
                Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, and Larry Bird begin to fade not
                because they weren’t individually dominant, but because their
                impact in team success comes short compared to that of our four
                final candidates. These four players manage to appear in the top
                five in both average career ELO and peak ELO simultaneously.
                That level of true, sustained superiority is reserved for
                <strong>LeBron James</strong>, <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>,
                <strong>Tim Duncan</strong>, and
                <strong>Shaquille O’Neal</strong>. These are the only legends
                who consistently lifted their teams to top-tier performance over
                long stretches and reached historically dominant peaks according
                to this context-adjusted metric.

                From there, LeBron James takes the lead, as he ranks #1 in both

                exceptional performance throughout the longest meaningful prime
                the sport has ever seen. But let's take a closer look at how

                As can be seen, Tim Duncan holds the strongest regular season
                win percentage, surpassing an impressive \(70\%\) win
                percentage. He is followed by Shaq with just over \(67\%\),
                Jordan with nearly \(66\%\), and James with almost \(64\%\). It
                is worth noting that in losses, Jordan’s teams were favored by
                only \(38.62\) ELO points on average, while the other three
                players were favored by more than \(60\) ELO points—and Duncan’s
                teams even exceeded a \(100\)-point advantage in those games.
                However, in wins, LeBron’s teams had the smallest advantage
                compared to their opponents, with roughly \(20\) fewer ELO
                points than Jordan and Duncan and \(10\) fewer than Shaq. In
                other words: although the teams of all four superstars were
                typically favored in losses, Jordan’s were the least favored—and
                while they were usually favored in wins as well, LeBron’s were
                the least favored among the group. In the next table, we present

              <strong>Table 9.- </strong> Playoffs ELO statistics for LeBron
              James, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                As can be seen, the situation changes quite a bit in the
                playoffs. The win percentages of O'Neal and Duncan drop
                considerably, reflecting the higher level of competition in the
                postseason. This is also reflected in the average ELO difference
                between these players’ teams and their opponents: although all
                of them remain favorites in both wins and losses (on average),
                the margins have decreased significantly. Specifically, LeBron
                James now has the smallest ELO difference in both losses and
                wins.
                <strong
                  >This means that, in the playoffs, he has faced comparatively
                  tougher opponents than Jordan, Shaq, or Duncan.</strong
                >
                Furthermore, in the next table, it can be observed in detail his
                advantage (at the beginning of the series) in each of the
                playoff series that he has played along with the result of the
                series.

              <strong>Table 10.-</strong> LeBron James playoff series results
              along with his team's ELO advantage at the beginning of the series
              (positive means that his team is favorite)
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify"></p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                In the table above, it can be observed that LeBron James has
                played a total of \(55\) playoff series to date, of which he has
                won \(41\) and lost \(14\), yielding a \(74.55\%\) winning rate
                in playoff series. Of the \(14\) series he lost, he was the
                favorite according to the ELO rating in only \(4\) of them: the
                2009 ECF against Orlando, the 2010 2nd Round against Boston, the
                2021 1st Round against Phoenix, and the 2025 1st Round against
                Minnesota. In these series, his advantage averaged a significant
                \(62.55\) ELO points, capturing the big upsets in the Phoenix,
                Minnesota and Orlando series. It is worth noting that
                <strong
                  >in the six Finals he lost, in every case the opposing team
                  had a higher ELO than his team—on average by \(84.5\)
                  points</strong
                >. The 2007, 2017, and 2018 Finals are especially striking, as
                his team faced an ELO disadvantage of around \(100\) points.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                On the other hand, of the \(41\) series he won, in \(7\) of them
                his team was not the favorite. Moreover,
                <strong
                  >of the 4 championships he won, he was the favorite only in
                  the 2020 Finals</strong
                >, i.e., according to ELO his wins against OKC, San Antonio, and
                Golden State were all upsets.

                Now, let’s compare this with Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan and
                Michael Jordan, whose series results are shown in the tables
                below. The reader should keep in mind that first-round playoff
                series prior to 2003 were best-of-five. Let's start with
                Shaquille O'Neal.

              <strong>Table 11.-</strong> Shaquille O'Neal playoff series
              results along with his team's ELO advantage at the beginning of
              the series (positive means that his team is favorite)

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                In the table above, it can be observed that Shaquille O'Neal
                played a total of \(45\) playoff series, of which he won \(32\)
                and lost \(13\), representing a \(71.11\%\) winning rate in
                playoff series. Of the \(13\) series he lost, he was the
                favorite according to the ELO rating in \(6\) of them, generally
                with close margins around \(30\) ELO points, though the 2004 NBA
                Finals loss against the Detroit Pistons stands out with a ELO
                advantage of \(116.56\) points.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                On the other hand, of the \(32\) series he won, in only \(4\) of
                them his team was not the favorite. Additionally, the average
                ELO advantage in his playoff series wins was \(90.31\) ELO
                points. In fact, his team was the favorite in all of his playoff
                series from 2000 until the Second Round of the 2006 Playoffs.

                  >Regarding his 6 Finals appearances, he was the favorite in 4
                  of them (winning 3 championships) and not the favorite in 2
                  (although he managed to win one of those
                  championships)</strong
                >. Nevertheless, this spectacular résumé of the most dominant
                player in history still doesn’t reach LeBron’s rating. Both his
                slightly lower winning percentage in playoff series and playoff
                games, and the fact that, on average, his teams had a higher ELO
                advantage, place him behind LeBron on the NBA ELO ranking.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Tim Duncan played a total of \(48\) playoff series, winning

                rate.

                On the other hand, of the \(35\) series he won, in only \(3\) of
                them his team was not the favorite. However, the average ELO
                difference was only around \(30\) points. Additionally, the
                average ELO advantage in his playoff series wins was \(89.59\)
                ELO points. In fact, his team was the favorite in all of his
                playoff series from 1991 onwards. Consequently, in all of his 6
                Finals he was the favorite to win it all.

                  them and won 5 rings</strong
                >, although the Miami Heat secured the victory with a
                spectacular comeback in 2013. Nevertheless, Tim Duncan’s legacy
                is extraordinary: he embodied the culture of San Antonio, was
                one of the most underrated big men in NBA history, and had a
                tremendous impact on the success of his teams. He earned
                numerous individual awards and accolades, demonstrating both
                consistency and excellence over his long and prolific career.
                Yet, he still does not surpass LeBron in ELO rating. The
                underlying reason is that the metric heavily values the ability
                to pull off upsets and penalizes heavily being the one who gets
                upset.

              along with his team's ELO advantage at the beginning of the series
              (positive means that his team is favorite)
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify"></p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                Michael Jordan played a total of \(37\) playoff series, winning
                \(30\) and losing \(7\), representing a
                <strong
                  >\(81.08\%\) winning rate in playoff series, the highest among
                  all four</strong
                >. Of the \(7\) series he lost, he was the favorite according to
                the ELO rating in only \(1\) of them: the 1995 Second Round
                against Orlando, though his advantage was only \(35.44\) ELO
                points.
              </p>
              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                On the other hand, of the \(30\) series he won, in only \(2\) of
                them his team was not the favorite. Namely, these were the 1st
                and 2nd round of the 1989 playoffs. However, both matchups were
                fairly leveled since the average ELO difference was barely
                \(7.43\) points. Additionally, the average ELO advantage in his
                playoff series wins was \(125.31\) ELO points.
                <strong
                  >In fact, his team was the favorite in all of his playoff
                  series from 1991 onwards. Consequently, in all of his 6 Finals
                  he was the favorite to win it all.</strong

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                While Jordan’s competitive spirit and winning ability are
                unmatched, this helps explain his position below LeBron James in
                the rankings.
                <strong
                  >Michael Jordan won throughout his career only and exclusively
                  when he was expected to win</strong
                >. This is in no way meant to diminish his legacy. On the
                contrary,
                <strong
                  >sustaining perfection and meeting sky-high expectations for
                  six championship runs is an extraordinary accomplishment that
                  deserves the highest admiration</strong
                >. Jordan’s greatness was so overwhelming that he often became
                the expectation itself — when he stepped on the court, the story
                felt already written, and the rest of the league was merely
                trying to rewrite fate. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge
                that in the early stages of his career, defeating powerhouse
                teams like the Celtics or the “Bad Boys” Pistons would have been
                nearly impossible when considering the massive ELO gaps between
                those teams and the Bulls.

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                However, this metric is defined on the grounds of rewarding
                <strong>winning relative to expectations</strong>. Therefore,
                given the results, we can say that in the eyes of this metric,
                <strong
                  >LeBron’s victories against the odds carry more weight than
                  Jordan’s wins when his team was superior to its
                  opponent.</strong
                >
              </p>

              <p class="max-width-900 large pb-30 text-justify">
                So, while the GOAT debate will always involve subjective
                elements like aesthetics, narrative, and cultural influence, an
                objective framework that rewards sustained excellence against
                the strength of competition points decisively in one direction:
                <strong>LeBron James stands alone as the true NBA GOAT</strong>.
